I study at the **University of Waterloo**. I like ML research and pure mathematics.

<div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"></div>

Currently, I'm at [Viggle AI](https://viggle.ai/) working on product and applied AI. This summer, I'll be joining [Faire](https://faire.com) to work on ML platforms.

I also research training methodologies for multimodal image editing adapters. Send me an email if you want to build with me.

<br>

I've lived in India, Thailand, Morocco, and Singapore. Now, I'm in Canada.

## Things I'm Doing
- Eating and putting my thoughts in [Plate]({{ '/plate' | relative_url }}).
- Sometimes hosting [research hackathons](https://meethackos.vercel.app/) (you should come!)
- Reading ML papers. 

<br>

## Things I've Done
- I went on exchange to the National University of Singapore (NUS) for Fall 2025.
- I demoed audio-reactive generative art at the [Socratica](https://www.socratica.info/) Symposium 2025.
- I built AI-native products for lawyers at [CaseClock](https://caseclock.ai/).
- I researched [wind dynamics super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13729) with Jacob Schnell, under Prof. Yuhao Chen, at the University of Waterloo.
- I wrote [algorithms for stable and deterministic module replacement in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18670) with the Bradbury Group.
- I engineered real-time solutions for [unsupervised network anomaly detection](https://www.trisul.org/blog/deep-learning-network-monitoring/) by intentionally overfitting VAEs on network heatmaps.
